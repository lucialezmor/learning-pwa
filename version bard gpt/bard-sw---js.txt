Here is the JavaScript code that you can use to convert an HTML/CSS website into a PWA:

JavaScript
// Create a service worker
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("service-worker.js");
}

// Create a manifest file
const manifest = {
  name: "My PWA",
  short_name: "My PWA",
  description: "This is my Progressive Web App",
  icons: [
    {
      src: "/images/icon-192.png",
      sizes: "192x192",
      type: "image/png",
    },
    {
      src: "/images/icon-512.png",
      sizes: "512x512",
      type: "image/png",
    },
  ],
  background_color: "#ffffff",
  theme_color: "#000000",
  start_url: "/",
};

// Write the manifest file to disk
const fs = require("fs");
fs.writeFileSync("manifest.json", JSON.stringify(manifest, null, 2));

// Add the manifest file to the HTML page
const head = document.head;
const link = document.createElement("link");
link.href = "manifest.json";
link.rel = "manifest";
head.appendChild(link);
